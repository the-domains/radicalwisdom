How many times have you found yourself feeling as if you need to consult an expert about fixing you? Have you ever noticed that we have not exactly been brought up to trust ourselves? It's been my lifelong target to trust me, my body and what I know is true for me. And guess what? Only I get to choose what works for me - it's kind of like consulting someone else about needing to poop or pee or whether you like broccoli or ice cream. You know what you know. No validation required there, right?

Yap. That.

So everywhere you have been giving away your power, your potency and right to choose what works best for you, will you please cut that out?

(And I say this as much to me as to all of you - always a good reminder )
